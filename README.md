This application does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users.

Some features of the app involve sending user-provided input (such as goal descriptions or prompts) to OpenAI’s API to generate suggestions and assist with goal planning. These requests are sent anonymously and are not linked to any user-identifiable information. However, we do not control how OpenAI processes or stores these requests. For more details, please refer to OpenAI’s Privacy Policy.

The app does not use analytics, does not track user behavior, and does not integrate with any third-party advertising or data collection tools.
